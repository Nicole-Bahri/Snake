# Snake :snake:

A version of the snake game written in pygame.
La culebrita is a basic game where if the snake eats a sushi 	:sushi: it gets longer and your score increases. If your snake hits any part of its body it will die. The user 
controls he direction of the snake's head (up, down, left or right) with the arrow keys and the snakeÂ´s body follows.The player can't stop the movement of the snake 
while the game is running.

Below are some images about the current state of the game, which **is still under construction** :point_down:
